            APPOINTMENTS To book an appointment please use our online booking service (https://patient.emisaccess.co.uk), phone reception or visit the surgery between our normal working hours of 8am and 6.30pm Monday to Friday. We offer a mixture of appointments available on the day and appointments that can be booked in advance. We do offer our patients the opportunity to pre book an appointment from 7.30am on Tuesday and Thursday, until 7pm Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and between the hours of 8.00am and 9.30am on a Saturday morning. We would respectfully ask patients that can attend the surgery during the day for routine treatment to do so. By doing this you will help those patients who need to see a GP for routine care but have difficulty coming to the surgery during our normal working hours. Before 8am and after 6.30pm Monday to Friday and on a Saturday morning we will not be able to see you for any problem that requires urgent attention. You will need to ring the out of hours service. The easiest way to access the out of hours service is to ring the surgery and your call will be diverted. The GP appointments offered outside our normal working hours are only for routine care. If you attend the surgery during the extended hours time periods and do not have a pre-booked appointment we will not be able to see you. The telephone lines will be answered by the practice from 8.00am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. Outside of these times your call will be diverted to the out of hours service. A receptionist will be available in reception from 8am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. During these hours they will be able to assist with appointment booking and the ordering of prescriptions. If You No Longer Require Your Appointment If you are unable to attend your appointment please ring us on 0117 9591919 and cancel as soon as possible so that your appointment can be used by someone else. Telephone Advice If you wish to speak to a doctor please telephone the practice on 0117 9591919. The receptionist will ask you for a short message and your telephone number. The doctor will call you back. Home Visits If you are too unwell to come to the surgery, please telephone your visit request BEFORE 10.30am as the doctor’s plan their rounds at that time. The doctor may telephone you first to discuss your problem. You may be seen sooner if you can be brought to the surgery. Out Of Hours Calls If you or a member of your family are in need of urgent medical advice or treatment please contact the duty doctor by telephoning the Surgery on 0117 9591919.

 “The demands on the Health Service are increasing, especially on the Accident and Emergency Department.  Please remember that the Accident and Emergency Department as it says is for accidents and emergencies.  By going there when you haven’t had an accident or when it is not an emergency you will clog up the system and prevent doctors and nurses there from dealing with genuine accidents and emergencies.  Apart from this the doctors in the Accident and Emergency Department are designed to deal with accidents and emergencies not with chronic diseases or minor ailments so by attending the Accident and Emergency Department with these problems you will not be getting the best or appropriate treatment.  Please bare this in mind.” For medical problems outside our opening hours please phone 111 and you will be directed to the appropriate service.

We have increased our capacity for routine pre bookable appointments and now offer these between 5pm and 8pm Monday to Friday, and on a Saturday between 8.00am and 4pm and Sunday between 9am and 1pm

We are working with 3 other local practices, (Guiseley and Yeadon, Yeadon Tarn and The Menston and Guiseley practice) to deliver this, and the service is held at Yeadon Health Centre, staffed by regular GPs. Eventually we hope to have practice nurses.  You can book your appointment with the receptionist.

            APPOINTMENTS To book an appointment please use our online booking service (https://patient.emisaccess.co.uk), phone reception or visit the surgery between our normal working hours of 8am and 6.30pm Monday to Friday. We offer a mixture of appointments available on the day and appointments that can be booked in advance. We do offer our patients the opportunity to pre book an appointment from 7.30am on Tuesday and Thursday, until 7pm Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and between the hours of 8.00am and 9.30am on a Saturday morning. We would respectfully ask patients that can attend the surgery during the day for routine treatment to do so. By doing this you will help those patients who need to see a GP for routine care but have difficulty coming to the surgery during our normal working hours. Before 8am and after 6.30pm Monday to Friday and on a Saturday morning we will not be able to see you for any problem that requires urgent attention. You will need to ring the out of hours service. The easiest way to access the out of hours service is to ring the surgery and your call will be diverted. The GP appointments offered outside our normal working hours are only for routine care. If you attend the surgery during the extended hours time periods and do not have a pre-booked appointment we will not be able to see you. The telephone lines will be answered by the practice from 8.00am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. Outside of these times your call will be diverted to the out of hours service. A receptionist will be available in reception from 8am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. During these hours they will be able to assist with appointment booking and the ordering of prescriptions. If You No Longer Require Your Appointment If you are unable to attend your appointment please ring us on 0117 9591919 and cancel as soon as possible so that your appointment can be used by someone else. Telephone Advice If you wish to speak to a doctor please telephone the practice on 0117 9591919. The receptionist will ask you for a short message and your telephone number. The doctor will call you back. Home Visits If you are too unwell to come to the surgery, please telephone your visit request BEFORE 10.30am as the doctor’s plan their rounds at that time. The doctor may telephone you first to discuss your problem. You may be seen sooner if you can be brought to the surgery. Out Of Hours Calls If you or a member of your family are in need of urgent medical advice or treatment please contact the duty doctor by telephoning the Surgery on 0117 9591919.

            All of our surgeries are open access which means that you do not have to wait for an appointment and you can always guarantee to see your Doctor on the day that you are sick.   However,sometimes that may mean that there will be a lot of people waiting to see the GP and your wait may be a long one.   Please don't arrive in the last 15 minutes of surgery time as the Doctor may have to leave promptly to visit very sick patients.

            APPOINTMENTS To book an appointment please use our online booking service (https://patient.emisaccess.co.uk), phone reception or visit the surgery between our normal working hours of 8am and 6.30pm Monday to Friday. We offer a mixture of appointments available on the day and appointments that can be booked in advance. We do offer our patients the opportunity to pre book an appointment from 7.30am on Tuesday and Thursday, until 7pm Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and between the hours of 8.00am and 9.30am on a Saturday morning. We would respectfully ask patients that can attend the surgery during the day for routine treatment to do so. By doing this you will help those patients who need to see a GP for routine care but have difficulty coming to the surgery during our normal working hours. Before 8am and after 6.30pm Monday to Friday and on a Saturday morning we will not be able to see you for any problem that requires urgent attention. You will need to ring the out of hours service. The easiest way to access the out of hours service is to ring the surgery and your call will be diverted. The GP appointments offered outside our normal working hours are only for routine care. If you attend the surgery during the extended hours time periods and do not have a pre-booked appointment we will not be able to see you. The telephone lines will be answered by the practice from 8.00am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. Outside of these times your call will be diverted to the out of hours service. A receptionist will be available in reception from 8am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday. During these hours they will be able to assist with appointment booking and the ordering of prescriptions. If You No Longer Require Your Appointment If you are unable to attend your appointment please ring us on 0117 9591919 and cancel as soon as possible so that your appointment can be used by someone else. Telephone Advice If you wish to speak to a doctor please telephone the practice on 0117 9591919. The receptionist will ask you for a short message and your telephone number. The doctor will call you back. Home Visits If you are too unwell to come to the surgery, please telephone your visit request BEFORE 10.30am as the doctor’s plan their rounds at that time. The doctor may telephone you first to discuss your problem. You may be seen sooner if you can be brought to the surgery. Out Of Hours Calls If you or a member of your family are in need of urgent medical advice or treatment please contact the duty doctor by telephoning the Surgery on 0117 9591919.

Telephone triage and telephone consultation:
To ease the winter pressure the Practice is offering a telephone triage and telephone consultations every Monday between January and March 2014.

If you feel unwell and require a telephone consultation please telephone the surgery on Monday morning between 9am and 10am on 020 8332 7515. The receptionist or Health Care Assistant will ask you a few questions to assess your condition. According to your clinical needs, you will either be given an appointment or a telephone consultation with a GP.

If you were booked for a telephone consultation, the GP will call you back between 11am and 12pm and will offer you advice for your clinical condition.


ONLINE PATIENT RECORDS
The Practice offers their patients access to Online Patient Records since April 2015.
Please ask at Reception for a Patient Online Registration Form.

            Our reception is open 8:00am - 6:30pm Every weekday, We run extended access clinics until 8:00pm on Mondays and Tuesdays for pre booked appointments only. 

To book an appointment:

The patient telephones the surgery and leaves their name, contact number and a brief description of their symptoms.

Patient will be offered a telephone consultation with the GP of their choice, where possible.

The doctor will then call the patient to discuss their condition. The doctor will then either make an appointment for the patient to come to see them on the same day or give advice and treatment over the telephone, as appropriate.

We will have a limited number of face-to-face afternoon appointments available for returns that have been requested by a doctor.
Why does my practice close some Wednesdays?

Keeping up to date with new treatments and techniques is really important in the NHS. Once a month on a Wednesday morning - our GPs go to training events to help make sure that you are getting the very best care possible.

On these days you can still be seen by our out of hours service during this time.  If you need to see a Dr before our Surgery is open again call 0330 100 4471.

Here are the dates and times we will be closed this year:

            We also offer appointments at our local hub (East One Health at 14 Deancross Street, London, E1 2QA) between 18:30-20:00, Monday – Friday, and 8:00-20:00 Saturday and Sunday. These are a mixture of pre booked appointments with a doctor or nurse which may be booked after speaking to a nurse/doctor at the practice, and some urgent appointments access via the normal GP out of hour’s service. The hub is mostly staffed by local GPs although it may well not be staff from this practice. Staff will have access to your medical records, but only if you give your consent. This means you may be offered an appointment on Saturday or Sunday if this is convenient for you. You will need to speak to one of our GPs to access evening and weekend appointments. This is an opportunity to try and help working people who may struggle with taking time out during the week for some routine appointments, but it is also important not to undermine the continuity of care in practices so there will be a limited number of conditions that we are able to book into these appointments.

            We are closed for essential staff training and meetings every Wednesday from 1330- 1445hrs.      

Summer Service Notice : From Monday 31st July until Friday 25th August 2017 we will be altering our service to “book on the day” appointments only. There will be no pre-bookable Doctor appointments during this time (pre-bookable Nurse Clinic appointments will continue) but we would like to assure you that you will still be seen as needed. 
- Sick parade continues for Serving Personnel from 0730Hrs to be seen that day.
- Families patients are invited to call from 0800Hrs for an appointment that day.  

We thank you for your cooperation in trialling this new way of working, where we envisage being able to provide good access for appointments whilst we have a period of reduced manning over the summer leave period.

We would welcome your feedback via the feedback form, comments book or our Practice Manager

            Consultations are by appointment only.  You can choose which GP you see; some will have appointments available sooner than others.  The doctors and other health professionals consult in English but should you require an interpreter please let the surgery know.
We offer early morning GP appointments on Tuesday mornings from 7.25am to accommodate those patients who find it difficult to get to the surgery within normal working hours. We occasionally have early and late nurse surgeries as well, please ask for details of any upcoming ones.
You can register for our online service to make appointments using our secure website, alternatively you can call the surgery every weekday between 8am and 6pm, excluding Bank Holidays.
You may simply require medical advice which can be given over the phone; usually a doctor will call you back if you leave a message with the receptionist giving brief details of the problem or query.

            If demand is high the appointment times are extended.  We offer pre-bookable appointments but there is usually a wait of about a week.  If you would like to see a particular doctor you may have to wait a little longer.  Most of our doctors are at the surgery for two days a week.  We have extended the amount of 'same day' appointments and you may be asked to phone back on the day of your choice.  We feel this has cut down on DNA's (patients who do not attend).

A doctor's working day comprises of administration as well as seeing patients. The administration component of being a GP has increased considerably over the years and can sometimes take upto 50% of the working day. During the break in between surgeries, the doctor will read and action hospital letters, complete referrals and tasks from the surgery, answer queries, check blood test results, issue medications, conduct home visits and deal with any emergencies.       There are also regular meetings with district nurses, community matrons and social workers to discuss complex cases. In addition, the doctors and nurses have a responsibility to complete frequent audits to ensure care and quality is maintained. Furthermore, practice meetings also take place to discuss any issues or improvement projects within the practice. Educational meetings allow doctors and nurses to keep our skills and knowledge upto date. All of these tasks ensure that the practice runs as efficiently and safely as possible.

            Our telephone lines are open from 8am. 
We have a few same day urgent appointment slots that patients can book into if they ring the surgery at 8am. Any urgent requests for appointments that are received after these appointments have been filled are directed to our morning Duty Doctor, who will then triage these calls and if the doctor feels it is clinically necessary they will ask the patient to come to the surgery to see him/her that morning. Many more problems can be dealt with by the Duty Doctor than if they had a normal surgery, other than face to face appointments the Duty Doctor can arrange to issue prescriptions, sick notes, give advice etc or book an appointment with another doctor later in the week if the problem does not need to be dealt with that day. 
Patients who wish to book a routine appointment are asked to ring after 10.30am  or for test results between 11am and 3pm, when the phone lines are less busy.

            We have extended hours BY APPOINTMENT ONLY on Thursday mornings 7.30am - 8am and Tuesday evenings between 6.30pm and 8pm.

We also operate a SIT & WAIT surgery Monday to Friday between 10am - 11am.  This is suitable for acute conditions that may have made you unwell within the last few days and that you feel cannot wait until the next available appointment.  All patients arriving within this time frame will be seen but you cannot stipulate a clinician of choice. Due to the amount of patients waiting at any one time, it is not suitable for ongoing problems, referrals, medical certificates, repeat prescriptions or where you know you are likely to require a long discussion during the consultation, a booked appointment would be more appropriate for these.

            Additional information
            We run eight ""never-full"" surgeries every week.  These are at 1130 every morning and 1700 on the evenings we have an afternoon surgery.  If you want to be seen that day and there are no appointments left in the normal surgeries you will be offered an appointment in the ""never-full"" surgery and told how many other patients are already booked to be seen that day.  We see patients in the order they book and not when they arrive so coming early does not mean you will be seen sooner and other patients arriving later may be seen before you.    The GP doing these surgeries will be the duty GP for that day.  If you particularly want to see one of the three GPs or you are following up a problem it is best to plan ahead and book with the doctor you want or the one who has been seeing you.  We encourage patients to avoid flitting between GPs to get different opinions.   These ""never-full"" appointments are best for problems that have recently arisen and you want to get immediate care.  We will see everyone who books but routine review appointments that can be booked weeks ahead are best seen in the normal surgeries by your usual GP.

We keep a small number of appointments free at the start of every surgery so patients  becoming ill overnight can be seen at the start of the day.  If you have a problem that may need a test sent to the hospital (almost all infections) please tell the receptionist and  come in the morning. We may see you quickly between other patients before the courier collects our samples at 1130.  In general we do not treat infections until we have a hospital report confirming the diagnosis and the need (or not) for antibiotics. 

If you need a home visit please ring as early as possible.  The GP will usually ring you soon after the request to start your care.

You can speak to a GP on the telephone and good times to do this are before the surgery starts between 0800 and 0830 and after the surgery has ended around 12 noon and 1730.  On Tuesdays the GP will ring you back once she has finished seeing patients and this may be in the afternoon.  If you ring during the surgery the call will not be put through to the GP if they are with another patient and you will be given a time to ring back when the GP is more likely to be free to take the call.   Emergency calls (like a collapse) will always interupt the GP. 

On Tuesday between 1200 and 1830 the surgery is covered by Fovant Surgery and calls are automatically redirected.  On Thursday evening between 1700 and 1830 calls are redirected to a Hindon Surgery GP mobile telephone.  This is to answer emergency calls and is not a suitable time to ring for routine matters like booking appointments or getting test results. In the past two years  almost every call was to book an appointment or some other routine matter.

The extended hours surgeries (18:30 - 19:00) do not operate on some evenings during leave periods.  They are intended for working patients who have difficulty coming at other times. 

When we are open all the usual nursing and dispensary services are also available except during the extended hours surgeries and the annual Saturday morning 'flu clinics in October.

Please allow 48 hours for prescription requests to be fulfilled.

            Additional information
            In addition to booked surgeries, we also offer OPEN SURGERY. This facility is offered on weekday mornings for those who have problems that are urgent or quick and cannot wait for a routine appointment.  If you arrive between 8.30 – 10.00am you will be seen by whichever doctor is holding open surgery that morning.  All patients attending the open surgery, including children, will be seen in order of arrival.  However, should a patient have an urgent medical need, they will be given priority.  Inevitably there will be times when this surgery is busy so please be prepared to wait.  Please do not abuse the open surgery: book an appointment if the problem is not urgent.  This surgery is not suitable for long term or on-going problems.  For these, or if you wish to see a particular doctor, you should make an appointment.CONSULTATION BY TELEPHONE Some problems can easily be resolved by discussion with a doctor over the telephone. To do this please telephone 01883 347811 before 10.30am. The doctor will then ring you back after their morning surgery.
Appointments to see both doctors and nurses can be booked up to 4 weeks in advance.
We also offer OUT OF HOURS APPOINTMENTS Tuesday and Friday mornings from 7.30am-8.00am and Tuesday evenings 6.30pm-7.30pm.

            Travel Advice
Planning a holiday? Before you travel ensure you are fully immunised

Are you possibly planning or have a trip abroad and are seeking travel health advice.  Aegis Medical Centre offers a travel advice service.

What you need to do?

We would first ask you to complete a travel risk assessment form so we can assess your risk, the recommended vaccines, any necessary malaria tablets (if you are travelling to a malarious region) and the advice most appropriate for your needs.

How do you do this? 

THIS FORM IS FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WEB PAGE AT THE NEXT ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS. 

please complete the print out form and drop into the practice or you can collect a paper form from the surgery and return it.  Whichever way you choose this must be done before you are seen in an appointment.
Please also contact the surgery to book the initial appointment as early as possible, - 

THIS SHOULD BE AT LEAST SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF YOUR DEPARTURE DATE OR EVEN EARLIER IF POSSIBLE, as a second appointment will be required with the practice nurse to actually receive the vaccinations.  Some of the vaccinations have to be ordered in as they are not all a stock item. 

What will happen then?

You will be booked in to see Marion - Practice Nurse for a risk assessment consultation in which she will advise you on all aspects of travel advice, including any vaccines needed and/or malaria tablets required.

PLEASE BE AWARE THE AEGIS MEDICAL CENTRE DOES NOT PROVIDE PRIVATE TRAVEL VACCINES.

NHS travel vaccines will always be offered if you need them (these include hepatitis A, typhoid and diphtheria, tetanus, polio and sometimes cholera).  For more details on this please see NHS Choice (see below).

If you need a private travel vaccine, for example, yellow fever, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, then we will give you details of private travel clinics in the area that can provide this service.

Here are some resources to help you help us to provide you with the information required for travel abroad. It is always useful to do some personal research so you're more aware of your risks and advice available.

We also ask you to go to:
www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/

Look up the destination you are travelling to, print off the information, read it and bring with you when you attend your appointment.

Travelling to a malarious area?

If you would like to learn more about the malaria drugs before your appointment which is always helpful, then useful information can be found on the A-Z index on the top navigation bar of www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk and go to the information sheet entitled ‘Malaria’ then click on the section entitled ‘Taking Antimalarial Tablets’ 

http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/malaria.aspx

Travelling to a high risk rabies area?

            We are delighted to be able to offer pre-booked routine appointments with a doctor on Saturday mornings at present.
We are working within the Department of Health framework for extended hours and so we are not able to provide nurse appointments or investigations.  A chaperone will not be available, so some examinations will not be able to be performed.
Care for urgent healthcare is still provided over the weekend by the Out-of-Hours Service.  Saturday morning appointments are only pre-bookable and for routine medical care.

Appointments
All patients are seen by appointment. You may choose to see any doctor you wish.

This practice operates an advanced access system and you will be offered an appointment within two working days (same day appointments are always available if required). 

For this system to work smoothly we prefer to book doctors’ appointments no more than 48 hours in advance. If this is difficult please let us know and we will provide other options for you.

We also offer the opportunity to discuss your medical problem via telephone. Please mention this to the receptionist and we will arrange for a telephone consultation.
Alternatively we can call you back at the end of either morning or afternoon surgery.

Whilst we encourage our patients to consult us at the surgery whenever possible, home visits can be arranged for those housebound by illness or infirmity. Please telephone the surgery on 01564 739194 before 11.00 am if possible, or at any time in case of sudden severe illness.

We now offer online booking of some GP appointments - please contact reception for details

            We operate early morning GP and Practice Nurse appointments from 7:30am daily for patients who work.

**************************************************************************************************
Please note we close at 2.30pm on Wednesday afternoon for staff training.

**************************************************************************************************

Arranging an appointment.      When you contact the surgery either via phone or in person the following options are available and our receptionists will do their best to guide you to the most appropriate choice:

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Same day telephone advice.      These surgeries run from 0830-1830 Monday-Friday. 
You will usually be put straight through to the on-call doctor but if they are unavailable the receptionists will inform you of this and take a number on which we can contact you. This option should be used if you need guidance regarding treatment or if you are unsure if you need an appointment. It is also useful if you think that investigations or treatment may be appropriate before you are seen by a doctor e.g. if you think that you may be anaemic it may be appropriate for us to arrange blood tests and then review you with the results of these.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
 
Minor Illness Surgeries are available in the morning and afternoons.  The receptionist will guide you to one of these surgeries if appropriate. Please note that these are slightly shorter than routine appointments and the doctor will normally only be able to deal with the single problem that you have told the receptionist about. All the doctors do their best to run to time with these surgeries but due to on-call commitment some delays may be unavoidable.

 
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Booked routine appointments.   For ongoing problems we urge you to arrange follow up with the same doctor as this will improve continuity and quality of care.    We release routine appointments in stages up to two weeks in advance and please book on of these appointments if there is a specific doctor that you wish to see.

2013 Shingles Vaccine launch

The Department of Health have advised that they will begin offering the shingles vaccine on a phased introduction. At Maypole Health Centre, we understand this to mean that they will be introducing the vaccine to certain age groups between the ages of 70 and 79 yrs.

We anticipate its introduction to be around Autumn ( flu season) and so we would anticipate inviting those who will fall into this criteria in at the same time as they would usually expect to attend for their seasonal flu vaccine making it doubly important to watch out for the flu clinic dates. Please be advised, we will be unable to vaccinate patients who do not fall inot the age groups defined by the Department of Health.

 




Urgent appointment:
If you consider your condition to be urgent, please tell the
receptionist. 

Cancellation of appointment:
If you are unable to keep your appointment, please let the
receptionist know as soon as possible ( not 5 or 10 minutes before time) so that the appointment can be offered to another patient.


Home visit:
Telephone the surgery before 10:30 am if you cannot come
to the surgery. Please remember that a doctor should only 
be asked to make a home visit if the patient is too ill to 
be brought to the surgery.


Change of personal details:
If you change your name, address or telephone number or mobile number, 
please notify the surgery as soon as possible at time of booking your appointment.

The receptionists are here to help you. They have a 
difficult job to do with phone calls and enquiries from 
all directions. When telephoning for medical attention,  
the receptionists may ask for a few details. They have been   
trained to make these enquiries in order to help you in 
the most appropriate way.

            Your Walk-in Centre has moved

Showell Park Walk-in Centre has moved from Friday 1st April 2016 to the new Urgent Care Centre, 1st floor, above the Emergency Department at New Cross Hospital.

The GP surgery will still be available at Showell Park Health Centre. In order to use this GP surgery you can register as a patient. Forms can be collected from the surgery reception or completed via this website. 

Walk in Centre services at the Phoenix Walk-in Centre, Parkfield Road, WV4 6ED will remain unchanged. They are available between 10am and 7pm Monday to Friday and 10am to 4pm on weekends and bank holidays.

Pharmacies, NHS111 or your GP are also available to offer advice.

Don’t forget that there are other healthcare options available instead of the Walk-in Centre or calling 999. Pharmacists can offer far more than just medicines. They can provide you with an on the day consultation to talk about your symptoms.

To improve access for all patients to your local GP practice it’s worth registering for Online Services. This allows patients to:

book appointments
request repeat prescriptions online
The receptionist at your practice can give you more information so you can get started. More information can be found on www.nhs.uk by typing Patient Online into the search box.

Patients should get the right care in the right place, the first time. Accessing the right care in the right place will usually result in reduced waiting times.

Please call NHS 111 or use NHS Choices for advice and guidance on where to access the right care for you.

            Additional information
            It is important to recognise that both Surgeries are extremely busy and the principle aim of the booking system is to ensure that patients can, and do, receive the support they need.  It is therefore necessary to operate a system which allocates appointments according to the level of need and urgency.


Contact with the both Surgeries can be made by phone, on-line or by visiting reception during normal surgery hours.  If you are phoning please state which surgery you prefer. The phones are particularly busy between 8am and 10am so please try and avoid these hours if you have a routine enquiry.  The on-line booking system is accessible 24h a day, 7 days a week and is an easy way to book routine appointments.  If you have not previously used the on –line booking system this may be arranged at reception (a consent form must be completed to enable the surgery to generate your login details).

There are a number of different ways of obtaining the help and support you need from the surgery:

•Routine appointments with all doctors may be booked 2 weeks in advance and the appointments are 10 minutes in length.  If you wish to cover several medical problems you may be asked to make a follow up appointment.

•Emergency appointments may be booked on the day.  These are 5 minute appointment and are appropriate for any medical problem which cannot wait for the next routine appointment and may be booked at either surgery. They may be used for problems such as infections as well as more serious complaints. Typically, in the time available, only one medical problem can be covered in these appointments. If all the emergency appointments have all been taken when you request an appointment the doctor will telephone you.  In some cases it may be possible to give telephone advice, arrange a prescription or offer an appointment on another day.  If however, as a result of the telephone consultation, it is felt that you (or your child) should be seen by the doctor an emergency appointment will still be made available on the same day.

•Home Visits. For those people who cannot visit the surgery for an appointment because they are too ill to attend or housebound, a Home Visit can be arranged.  Please phone before 10am to request a visit.  The doctor may phone you back before visiting.
 
•Telephone consultations can also be requested if you consider that it is not necessary, or not possible, to see the doctor in person. These are booked through the receptionist who will make the necessary arrangements.

•Practice Nurse/Nurse Practitioner.  It is not always necessary to see a doctor.  A number of consultations such as for contraception, cervical smears, well person checks, travel advice and dressings can be dealt with by the Practice Nurse or Nurse Practitioner. Please ensure that appointments for travel advice are made in good time – ideally at least 8 weeks prior to your date of departure. 

•Medication reviews – If a medication review is due please make a routine appointment with the doctor.  In some circumstances the review may be carried out by the practice nurse (e.g. Raised blood pressure, asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or contraception reviews) or by the Nurse Practitioner (e.g. Diabetes checks).  The receptionist or your doctor will be able to guide you as to which professional would be most appropriate.  In the event that the Surgery is not able to see you before your medication is due to run out they can arrange an interim prescription to cover you until you can be seen.

The Surgery recognises that there is considerable pressure on the appointment system.  If you are having difficulty making an appointment with the doctor of your choice or on the day of your choice the receptionists will endeavour to offer you an alternative or to advise you when an appointment may become available.  The Surgery review the appointment system regularly and welcome your feedback or ideas.  There is a comment box in each surgery.

Help the Surgery to help you!

•Seek self-help remedies where possible.  Discuss over-the-counter treatments with your local pharmacist.
•Be flexible about when you can attend and who you will see.
•Be organised about booking reviews in plenty of time and don’t wait until you have run out of medication before contacting the surgery.
•Only book an emergency appointment if you absolutely cannot wait until the next routine appointment.
•Only request a Home Visit if there is no way you can attend the surgery.

            Weekend Appointments - Bilborough Medical Centre

We wish to inform you that we will no longer be holding clinics on a weekend at this practice. This was a pilot which will end on the 30th June. This means, from 30 June we will no longer be able to offer appointments at the weekend.

NHS Nottingham City CCG* would like your feedback on whether you attended the weekend clinics and your thoughts about these. Surveys will be available from our reception from 15 June.

In line with new national guidance NHS Nottingham City CCG* is looking to offer additional appointments to see a GP or a Nurse in the evenings and at weekends at different locations across the City. This will be available to all Nottingham City patients. Your feedback in the surveys will support the CCG when designing this new service. 

We will share more information with you when this is available.

Should you need to contact the CCG directly about this please contact the Patient Experience Team on 0115 883 9570 or via email at: patientexperienceteam@nottinghamcity.nhs.uk

            Appointments
We are constantly monitoring and reviewing our appointment access.
We have a same day appointment/advice system. Call between 8.00am-1.00pm , give your request to the receptionist who will take the details regarding the problem and what outcome you would like, such as an appointment, referral, prescription etc.The receptionist will pass the details to our doctors to triage and give appropriate treatment and care required. A member of the Same Day Care Team (Dr, Nurse or receptionist) will then call you back and feedback to you what action the Dr has requested, such as offer an appointment, a tel consultation, referral, sicknote or prescription etc.

The aim of this system is to improve patient experience and access. We also hope to see less demand placed on the service at 8.00am with patients trying to get through early  as we promise to deal with all same day requests that day if received by 1,00pm. The earlier we get the request the quicker we will be able to access the patients needs and address them but there is no longer the need for the rush first thing in the morning due to appointments be allocated by the Dr through a triage service throughout the day.

We book appointments 2 weeks in advance but  do understand at the moment there is a wait for a routine appointment.

Routine appointments are for non urgent matters and made available with your usual GP up to one month in advance.  If your GP wishes you to come back for a follow up appointment, they will issue you with a slip asking reception to book you an appointment.

48 Hour Doctor appointments are avaialble if you cannot wait for your usual GP (though not the doctor of your choice) that can be booked 48 hours in advance.

Emergency Appointments are for urgent matters that have to be dealt with that day.  You will be given an appointment with our Nurse Practitioner who can diagnose and treat most common illnesses.

Our recent patient survey highlighted the desire for greater access to the doctors.  To meet this request, we will be offering

‘EARLY BIRD’ appointments at both North End and Steeple Claydon Surgery, 
 
2 Saturday morning appointments per calendar month at  North End.  

These appointments can be booked in advance and we hope this offers the flexibility for those who find it difficult to consult during our normal opening hours.

            How does it work?

111 will connect the caller to a team located in Peterborough of fully trained call advisers, who are supported by experienced nurses and paramedics. They will ask the caller questions to assess the symptoms, and give them the healthcare advice they need or direct the most appropriate and available local service.

Where possible, the NHS 111 team will book you an appointment or transfer you directly to the people you need to speak to. If NHS 111 advisers think you need an ambulance they will arrange for one to be sent to you.

People living in the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough area should continue to call their GP for non-urgent medical advice. 

The 111 service is being provided by Herts Urgent Care, an organisation that has a proven track record in providing the 111 service elsewhere.

Calls to 111 are recorded. All calls and the records created are maintained securely, and will only be shared with others directly involved with your care.

This hour is used for the GP's, Practice Nurses and Admin Team to receive educational training. We do invite speakers in to give talks and presentations. We have met with Healthwatch, Osteoarthritis Speaker, CPR, (resuscitation) and use of the defibrillator, we invited The Memory Clinic to speak with the Doctors and Nurses, they discussed screening and diagnosis of dementia patients, drug management of dementia patients and the complications of prescribing it. The Admin Team did their own Dementia Awareness Training with the Manager/RGN of a local Nursing Home specialising in Dementia Care. All Admin staff are now ""Dementia Friends"". Three times a year we close for a whole afternoon, this is so the whole practice can receive educational training on a larger scale.This training maybe on site or off site. This is in line with all Shrewsbury Practices. Contact details for emergency contacts are on the telephone messaging service.

            Additional information
             WE ARE A RESEARCH ACTIVE PRACTICE:
We have recently been accredited by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), as ‘Research Ready’ so we are able to participate in research studies that CliniclResearch Network (CRN) offers to benefit the wider community in the long term.

To become research ready the practice has completed an online self-accreditation questionnaire which covers the minimum requirements of The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, Department of Health (2005). The accreditation has been developed by the Royal College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and the CRN. 

The Clinical Research Network East of England (CRN EoE) is one of a family of national research networks working together with the Comprehensive Local Research Networks to provide a wide range of support to the local research community. Our Practice participates in research activity and works closely with the CRN EoE, creating more opportunities for more patients to be involved in research should they wish. 

No studies are compulsory and patients may decline any invitation to join a study.

            Drop-in Surgeries
 
We offer a drop-in surgery every morning from 9.00am – 10.30am.  This is for patients who feel they need to see a doctor the same day. Patients are seen in turn and should appreciate that there may be patients with appointments who will be seen before them. 
 
Please note – Emergencies Take Priority at All Times
 
Patients attending drop-in surgery must be present when their name is called or they will lose their place and be put at the back of the queue.  We therefore encourage patients to stay in the waiting room, once they are on the list, because it is difficult to predict the time at which they will be called.  
 
It is not possible to reserve a place in the drop-in surgery by telephone, or by calling at the surgery the previous day. Also, it is not possible to request to see a particular doctor at drop-in surgery.
 
Drop-in surgery is ideal if:
 
    -  your illness has developed or deteriorated very recently
    -  you are concerned that your condition should not wait until the next routine appointment.
 
However, drop-in surgery can be quite busy, and there is often a wait to be seen.  Because of this, the drop-in in not really appropriate for:
 
      - obtaining repeat prescriptions or results of tests
      - dealing with multiple problems
      - dealing with problems which have been present for some time
      - routine follow-up of chronic problems
 
If in doubt, please check with the receptionist

            From 1st June 2013 we are providing pre-bookable appointments that are outside of our usual opening hours. This will be one session per week and consist of a mixture of doctor's and nursing appointments. The sessions will usually be held in the evening, however we are endeavouring to provide some Saturday mornings as well.

These consultations are by appointment only and must be booked before the session.

These appointments are ideally suited to those patients who have difficulty in arranging an appointment with the Practice during our normal opening hours, e.g. work commitments.

To book an appointment with the Practice in one of these sessions, please ask at reception or telephone us on 01993 845600 for details of that week's ""Extended Hours"" session.

            Urgent Appointments and Calls

Urgent appointments are for people who are feeling unwell, distressed or in pain and need to see a doctor or nurse on the same day.

Duty Doctor

If you have an urgent health problem, you will always be able to speak to the emergency Duty Doctor on the same day. Once the receptionist has taken some brief details, the doctor will call you back and give you advice or arrange an emergency clinic appointment for you if this is necessary.

Express Clinic

The receptionist may offer you an appointment in our Express Clinic, where you will be assessed by one of our nurse practitioners. The nurse practitioners are able to assess and treat a range of common health problems and can prescribe medications if required.

            Please note that the surgery times may vary from day to day and we advise that you ring the surgery to book your routine appointments well in advance. At the present time routine appointments can be booked up to 6 weeks in advance with a doctor, our nurse practitioner or a nurse. We endeavour to see patients who require an urgent appointment on the day. It is helpful to give the receptionist an idea of the reason for your appointment so that he/she can give you an appointment with the most appropriate clinician. If you are unable to attend your appointment for any reason please call the surgery to cancel your slot. Please note that you do not need to see a doctor for a repeat presription unless it is a medication you haven't taken for a long time or you need a medication review (these are usually every 6-9 months). If you are unsure who to see please ask the receptionist for advice.
Please note that Saturday Surgeries are held on the second Saturday of the month except July and August

            APPOINTMENTS

The surgery operates an advanced access appointment system.  This means that we allow pre-booking appointments by up to 2 months and a certain amount of appointments are saved for patients that ring “on the day”. The ""on the day"" appointments are the GP appointments only and not the Practice Nurse appointments.

Please note the surgery offers same day appointments for all under 5 year olds.

We aim to be able to offer an appointment within 24 hours.  However, if you wish to specify a particular doctor you may need to wait longer.

            The practice is closed on the last Thursday of the month from 13:00 hours. Furthermore, the afternoon surgery times vary according to patient demand. From the feedback obtained from many patients (i.e the patients representative group), they prefer the afternoon sessions to start earlier. This avoids the rush hour commute, as on occasion it can be difficult to gain access to the shopping centre.

            Additional information
            Appointments can be booked by telephone, in person at the reception desk or via the internet.  If choosing the internet facility, you will need to pop into surgery with ID where an account will be set up for you there and then.  The practice provides both face to face appointments and telephone consultations. 

We ask that requests for home visits are made before 10.30am which will allow the visiting Doctor time between the morning and afternoon surgery. 

Please note that appointments with the doctor are for 10 minutes only. If you need to see one of the clinical team for numerous things, please explain this at the time of booking your appointment so the correct amount of time can be allocated for you.  

Routine chronic disease monitoring such as blood pressure, blood tests, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and COPD checks are done by our practice nursing team.

Minor ailments such as coughs, colds, sore throats, minor rashes, etc can be dealt with by a pharmacist. 

If the doctor has asked you to see him/her about test results or hospital correspondence please check the results are back before you make your appointment.

If you are unable to make it in for your appointment please let us know so we can use the time to see someone else. 

Our policy is that we do not see patients if they are more than 10 minutes late for their appointment as it will disrupt the appointment times for other patients.
 
When the Surgery is Closed

In possible life-threatening situations dial 999 for an emergency ambulance. For other urgent problems that really cannot wait until the next routine surgery please telephone NHS Direct on 111 for advice or telephone the surgery.  If you telephone the surgery ""out of hours"" you will be given the telephone number for the Out of Hours Primary Care Centre (run by Go To Doc).  

The Accident and Emergency Department should only be attended in the event of life threatening emergencies. Walk in Clinics can treat other less serious conditions and some pharmacies run Minor Ailment Clinics.

            The majority of GPs at Mill Street Medical Centre have 'portfolio careers'.  This means that they do not only work as GPs but also have other professional commitments.  This includes working as specialist GPs, teaching young doctors to become GPs (GP trainers) and also working as clinical leads for NHS St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group.  This can mean that there may be a delay in seeing a GP of your choice.  Some of our GPs also have young families and only work part-time.

            NHS 111 is a new telephone service for people in Yorkshire to call if they need medical help fast but are not in a life-threatening situation. The easy to remember, free to call number is being introduced across England to help reduce the pressure on A&E departments and the 999 service. Available 24 hours a day, 365 days a week, the service is available for people who aren’t sure if they need to go to A&E, don’t have a GP to call or generally need reassurance and advice. On dialling NHS 111 a team of fully trained advisers and experienced nurses will assess your condition and direct you to the local service that can help you best, when you need it. There are now only three numbers to know: 999 for life-threatening emergencies, your GP surgery and 111. For more information on NHS 111 visit nhs.uk/111.

You can ring the 111 number 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
Calls from landlines and mobile phones are free.

            The NHS 111 service is staffed by a team of fully trained advisers, supported by experienced nurses. They will ask you questions to assess your symptoms, then give you the healthcare advice you need or direct you straightaway to the local service that can help you best. That could be A&E, an out of hours doctor, a walk in centre, a community nurse, an emergency dentist or a late-opening chemist.

Where possible, the NHS 111 team will book you an appointment or transfer you directly to the people you need to speak to. If you need an ambulance, one will be sent just as quickly as if you had dialled 999.

If a health professional has given you a specific phone number to call when you are concerned about your condition, continue to use that number.

If you have difficulties communicating or hearing, you can use the NHS 111 service through a textphone by calling 18001 111.

Patients who are not well enough to travel will be visited at home by a duty doctor who may not be a member of this practice but will always be a qualified GP from the local area.

All calls are recorded.

            Extended Hours:    There are appointments available at both surgeries between 7.30 - 8.00am Monday to Friday. This access is aimed primarily at those who cannot attend during normal surgery hours. We must emphasise that these are for pre-booked appointments only and not for people to walk in and expect to be seen.

During the extended hours there will be no telephone access to the practice and you will not be able to pick up prescriptions or letters etc. Secondary care services have not increased their hours of access so will not be available during our extended opening times.

            Additional information
            The NHS 111 service is staffed by a team of fully trained advisers, supported by experienced nurses. They will ask you questions to assess your symptoms, then give you the healthcare advice you need or direct you straightaway to the local service that can help you best. That could be A&E, an out of hours doctor, a walk in centre, a community nurse, an emergency dentist or a late-opening chemist. 
Where possible, the NHS 111 team will book you an appointment or transfer you directly to the people you need to speak to. If you need an ambulance, one will be sent just as quickly as if you had dialled 999.
If a health professional has given you a specific phone number to call when you are concerned about your condition, continue to use that number.
If you have difficulties communicating or hearing, you can use the NHS 111 service through a textphone by calling 18001 111.
Patients who are not well enough to travel will be visited at home by a duty doctor who may not be a member of this practice but will always be a qualified GP from the local area.
All calls are recorded.

            NHS 111 is a new telephone service for people in Yorkshire to call if they need medical help fast but are not in a life-threatening situation.

The easy to remember, free to call number is being introduced across England to help reduce the pressure on A&E departments and the 999 service.  Available 24 hours a day, 365 days a week, the service is available for people who aren’t sure if they need to go to A&E, don’t have a GP to call or generally need reassurance and advice.

On dialling NHS 111 a team of fully trained advisers and experienced nurses will assess your condition and direct you to the local service that can help you best, when you need it.

There are now only three numbers to know: 999 for life-threatening emergencies, your GP surgery and 111.

For more information on NHS 111 visit nhs.uk/111.

            The NHS 111 service is staffed by a team of fully trained advisers, supported by experienced nurses. They will ask you questions to assess your symptoms, then give you the healthcare advice you need or direct you straightaway to the local service that can help you best. That could be A&E, an out of hours doctor, a walk in centre, a community nurse, an emergency dentist or a late-opening chemist. 
Where possible, the NHS 111 team will book you an appointment or transfer you directly to the people you need to speak to. If you need an ambulance, one will be sent just as quickly as if you had dialled 999.
If a health professional has given you a specific phone number to call when you are concerned about your condition, continue to use that number.
If you have difficulties communicating or hearing, you can use the NHS 111 service through a textphone by calling 18001 111.

            Additional information
            We know there a number of patients( frequent attenders) who need help with self care,  they present with very minor ailments for themselves and their families that could be treated at home.    These patients make up a large % of our daily appointment therefore there are less appointments free for patients with conditions that need care.

Make sure you have adequate medicine cabinet with a supply of treatments for cough and colds and paracetamol.   Always have a first aid kit with plasters to  treat minor  scuffs and abrasions.  Keep you medicine and first aid kit away from children and vulnerable adults.

            Additional information
            From 16th October 2017 following consultation with our PPG, we changed our appointment system to a more traditional face to face system. Face to face doctor appointments for the same day, the next day, two days time and a week ahead are released every weekday morning at 8am when the telephone lines open. We have a number of appointments that are also available to book online using the patient access system. Previously we have asked patients to call back at 12.30 for an afternoon appointment, this is no longer necessary as all appointments for the whole day are released at 8am. We offer a small number of telephone consultations these are useful  for followup calls after test results or where a face to face appointment is not required. Nurse and Phlebotomy appointments can be booked 4-6 weeks in advance.
We have  a number of commuter surgeries (early morning and evening clinics) and Saturday morning clinics for pre-bookable telephone appointments. Ask at Reception for more details about these clinics.We also offer a same day 'Sit and Wait' clinic, this is a walk in clinic for patients with new medical problems (no longer than 2 weeks old), the clinic is open for patients to check in at reception between 9am and 12.30pm. Patients are guaranteed to be seen by the doctor on duty the same day, however we cannot guarantee waiting times. Our Advanced Nurse Practitioners provide telephone call backs for patients. They can advise over the telephone and where necessary arrange an appointment in surgery. Our receptionists will advise you regarding the most appropriate clinician for you to see/speak to when you call in or visit the reception desk.

            Out-of-hours services are generally busy so please think carefully before asking to see a doctor and only do so if you genuinely cannot wait until the surgery re-opens.

In a genuine emergency you should call 999. Chest pains and / or shortness of breath constitute an emergency.

            Extended Access to Primary Care:

From 12 June 2017, this practice is taking part in the GP extended access service at Westbourne Green Community Healthcare Centre.

This means that you may be offered an opportunity to attend an evening (after 6.30 pm) or weekend appointment at Westbourne Green to see a health care professional  or to take part in other activities that will improve your health and wellbeing.

The service is run by Bradford Care Alliance, which represents most GP practices in the Bradford area.  Medical appointments are with GPs and other healthcare staff who work in the area; therefore, your appointment may not be with a clinician from this practice.

To use the service we will ask for your consent to share your medical record with the extended access service.  When you are offered an appointment, our receptionists will talk to you about what this means and why it is necessary.

•	You can read more about the extended hours service here
•	Westbourne Green Community Healthcare Centre is located at 26 Heaton Road, Bradford BD8 8RA

Please discuss your most urgent problem.  Please make another appointment for any other concerns.

            Additional information
            We now offer extended hours during the following times:

Monday morning from 7.30am

Monday evening

Saturday morning from 08.00am

The surgery will only provide limited services such as pre-booked appointments rather than offering the full range of services available during its ""normal"" opening hours.
The ""Extended Opening Hours"" surgeries are intended for patients who are not in a position to attend during the practice’s normal 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Monday to Friday surgeries

They are solely and exclusively for pre-booked appointments

There will be a limited number of Doctors and Nurses conducting Extended Hours surgery and no additional clinicians on site

""Extended Opening Hours"" surgeries will have a limited number of clinicians on a rota basis, meaning that there may be only one doctor and one Nurse seeing patients each week.

This means that your own doctor might only be in a position to offer ""Extended Opening Hours"" appointments once every few weeks.

Normal weekend or night-time Out of Hours arrangements will apply for acute or same day problems

The surgery will not be open to deal with acute or ""same day"" problems such as sudden illnesses, exacerbations of existing problems or accidents during its ""Extended Opening Hours"". The Telephones will not be open to book appointments or make enquiries.

Patients will still have to contact the Out of Hours service for immediately necessary medical advice and treatment.

            Additional information
            Registering as a Patient: You can register as a patient at Southgate Medical Group ONLY if you live in Southgate & your family in the same home are already registered with us.  Otherwise, our list is capped as per details at the top of this page.

If for any reason you are unable to attend any appointment please cancel your appointment by calling our Appointment Cancellation Line on 01293 536281. This is an answer service which asks you to leave specific details about the appointment you wish to cancel:

Appointment Cancellation Line
To save you both time and money trying to call the Surgery on the main number, there is a dedicated Appointment Cancellation Line

THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS 01293 536281

This number is an answer machine service where you will be prompted to leave your Name, your Date of Birth, the Date and Time of Appointment you wish to cancel and the Name of the Doctor or Nurse you were booked to see.

Your appointment will then be cancelled by a member of our staff and free's up an appointment for another patient.

Named GP
 
As part of the NHS commitment to providing more personalised care, from June 2015 all practices are required to provide all their Patients with a named GP who will have overall responsibility for the care and support that our surgery provides.
 
•This will not impact your experience at the practice, the provision of appointments, your treatment, or which GP you can see.
•You may wonder why your allocated GP is not necessarily the one you see most regularly.  Please be assured that you can still access all of our medical team in exactly the same way as before.
•Having a named GP does not guarantee you will always be seen by that GP.
•If you wish to be registered with a different GP we can alter this for you. However, this does not change the availability of appointments for that GP.
•Please note that the GP responsible for your care may be subject to change and reallocation in the future
You do not need to take any further action, but if you have any questions or wish to know your named GP, please speak to Reception.
 
What does 'accountable' mean?
This is largely a role of oversight, with the requirements being introduced to reassure patients that they have one GP within the practice who is responsible for ensuring that this work is carried out on their behalf.  

What are the named GP's responsibilities to 75s and over?
This is unchanged from 2014-2015; for patients aged 75 and over the named accountable GP is responsible for:
 
• working with relevant associated health and social care professionals to deliver a multi-disciplinary care package that meets the needs of the patient
•ensuring that these patients have access to a health check as set out in section 7.9 of the GMS Contract Regulations.
 Does the requirement mean 24-hour responsibility for patients?
No. The named GP will not:
 
•take on vicarious responsibility for the work of other doctors or health professional
•take on 24-hour responsibility for the patient, or have to change their working hours. The requirement does not imply personal availability for GPs throughout the working wee
•be the only GP or clinician who will provide care to that patient

Can patients choose their own named GP
In the first instance, patients should simply be allocated a named GP. However, if a patient requests a particular GP, reasonable efforts should be made to accommodate their preference, recognising that there are occasions when the practice may not feel the patient's preference is suitable.

Do patients have to see the named GP when they book an appointment with the practice?
No. Patients can and should feel free to choose to see any GP or nurse in the practice in line with current arrangements. However, some practices may see this change as a way to encourage and promote a greater degree of continuity of care for patients.

Friday afternoon emergency ""on the day"" appointments are available by contacting Reception. Our Receptionists will take your details and the Duty Doctor will suggest the best course of action, which may include a telephone consultation, requesting that you attend a walk-in surgery or a regular consultation the following week or offering you an appointment at the Friday afternoon emergency session. Please telephone as early as possible on the day to request an appointment. 

Extended hours appointments with the Doctor or Practice Nurse are available for patients who cannot get to the surgery during normal opening times.  These appointments can only be booked through Reception and not through the electronic booking service.

            Consultation with the Doctor and Nurse is by appointment only and separate appointments must be made for each patient so they can receive the individual attention to which they are entitled.  Appointments are normally booked at ten minute intervals but we know from experience that some problems may take longer than others and, if this does happen, we ask that you please be patient.  If you think you require longer, please book a double appointment.  There are set appointment slots for emergencies each day and we ask that these are only used for such circumstances.  The Doctor’s and Nurse’s time is valuable so if you are unable to attend a previously arranged appointment, please telephone reception as soon as possible as your appointment slot can always be re-allocated, even at short notice.

Dr J B Ghauri
Will see patients on a first come first seen basis but please call to inform staff that you will be attending; therefore we will be able to prevent too many patients in one session. Appointments may also be booked. 
 
Dr A J Ghauri
Will see patients via booked appointments.

Emergencies
Any emergencies brought into the surgery will be seen as soon as possible.

Extended Hours
On a Thursday evening we can now offer GP appointments between 6.30pm to 8.015pm. This is aimed at our patients who find it difficult to attend during our core opening hours. These sessions are by appointment only.


Appointments are not always necessary

If you attend the surgery without an appointment requesting to see a GP or the practice nurse, if they are available you will be seen.

This practice offers a limited number of additional doctor appointments outside usual opening hours. This provision is designed to help patients who are otherwise unable to attend surgery. 
These appointments are for routine matters only and must be booked in advance by contacting reception during usual opening hours. Please be aware that the appointments will be provided by the doctors of the practice on a rotational basis and that follow-up appointments and nurse team appointments (blood tests, ECG's etc) will generally need to be arranged during usual working hours. 
The extra appointments are available as follows: 
 

    
        
            
            Monday evenings 
            6.30pm - 7.30pm

Reception service is available at these sessions. 

Home visits and urgent problems during these times will continue to be handled by the Out of Hours service on 111.  

We hope that this service will benefit those patients who previously have had difficulty arranging appointments and ask that you continue to attend during the usual hours if at all possible.

If your problem can be sorted over the telephone please ring the surgery as normal and ask to speak to a Dr,  the receptionist will book you a 'telephone' appt, she will also ask you if you are happy to give her a brief reason for your call, this is not be nosey but so that the Dr knows ahead of time what the problem is.  If you feel that you would prefer not to disclose the reason for your call the receptionist will accept this.  If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait, we will do our best to put you through to your usual doctor but we would need to know what the problem was. Please be patient as the Dr may have someone with him/her and they will speak to you as soon as they are free.  We also offer 'telephone' appts that can be booked on-line via the Meridian Surgery website.

            We encourage patients to make appointments with their usual GP; however, we recognise that this will not be always possible for a variety of reasons. If this is not possible you will be offered another appointment with another GP or advised when your own GP is next available.

We have a number of appointments which enable you to book in advance as well as on the day.

Sometimes all that may be necessary is for the Doctor or Nurse Practitioner to give you advice over the telephone.  Please ask the receptionist or switchboard operator.

            The GPs now start clinic on Wednesday morning at 7.30am and our evening clinics  offered on Tuesday or Wednesday evening on rotation are now supported by a member of our practice nursing team. 
Please note these sessions are not intended as ‘walk-in’ or emergency sessions and only patients who have pre-booked their appointments will be seen. 
During these extended hours only reception cover is offered, we are therefore unable to assist with appointment bookings, prescription requests or test results during this time.
Emergency treatment for patients who cannot wait until the surgery re-opens may use the NHS 111 service.  This is available free of charge from all landlines and mobile networks.

            NHS 111 (starting 22.10.2015)

NHS 111 is a Department of Health idea of a single point of access for urgent care which seeks to improve and simplify access to non-emergency health care by providing a memorable three-digit telephone number that is free to the caller.

By calling NHS 111 callers get immediate access to clinical advice on their condition or triaged over the phone and then sign posted to the appropriate services.

If the reason for the call turns out to be an emergency, the call will be immediately passed to ambulance dispatch, which will then be managed just as if you had dialled 999. The line is staffed by a team of fully-trained call handlers supported by experienced senior clinical advisors, who will assess the symptoms and then signpost the caller directly to the most appropriate place of care.

Whether an out of hours doctor, a district nurse, a 24 hour chemist or an emergency dentist is needed, the NHS 111 team will make sure service users get the right help, first time.

The NHS 111 service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Calls from landlines and mobile phones are free - just like 999.

  When to use 111, you should call 111 if:

•It's not a 999 emergency
•You think you need to go to ED or another NHS urgent care service
•You don't think it can wait for an appointment with your GP, or
•You don't know who to call for medical help 
For less urgent health needs you should still contact your GP in the usual way.
For immediate, life-threatening emergencies, you should call 999.

            Extended Hours are from 18.30 on Monday evenings. When there are Bank or Public Holidays we sometimes have to adjust the rota to ensure we have one Extended Hours Clinic each week. 
DOCTORS’ AVAILABILITY and APPOINTMENTS
¨      MONDAY to FRIDAY APPOINTMENTS 9.00 to 11.30am and 3.30 to 5.50pm.
We run an appointment system for all surgeries and clinics. We have tried extremely hard to provide a comprehensive array of appointments to suit all types of patient requirement.
We use a system with fewer pre-booked appointments each day, but more appointments are available each day on a ‘first-come-first served’ basis, however it is not necessary to ring at 8:30 to receive an appointment for that day, please try a little later. Afternoon appointments are available from 12 o’clock each day.
If you are unable to keep an appointment please ring and cancel it as someone else may be able to use it.
Currently we provide
·                 Monday to Friday every week of the year except for bank holidays we have surgeries both morning and afternoon making ten sessions. Once a week there is one session of Extended Hours.
·                 Once a month there is no Thursday afternoon surgery due to all Shepway GPs attending Education events.
·                 Other than periods of annual leave we have both full time GPs who work between seven and nine sessions a week and part time GPs who work between 2 and 6 sessions a week. For ease of continuity the sessions are the same every week unless due to exceptional circumstances they have to be amended.

             These will be on occasional Thursday afternoons. During these periods, the surgery will be CLOSED from 12am to 6pm, and urgent cases will be dealt with via 111. Since the staff also receive training at these times, there will be no routine telephone lines open either. There will be a telephone message asking callers to call 111 for problems which cannot wait, or to call the surgery back the following day for routine matters.  The Thursdays affected are - : 19 Jan, 16 Feb, 16 March, 20 April, 18 May, 15 June, 20 July, 21 Aug 21 Sep, 19 Oct, 23 Nov & 21 Dec. Thank you for your understanding over this change, we are complying with the best practice guidelines on updating GPs and Staff and have adopted the Durham CCG standard practice.
As of the 4th of April we will no longer offer late doctors' appointments on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday evenings and the surgery will close at 6.00pm on these days.

One early morning surgery per week from 07.10 to 08.00 (usually a Wednesday but the day may vary).
One late evening surgery per month from 18.30 to 20.10 (usually Thursday).
Two Saturday surgery per month from 08.30 to 10.45. 
These appointments are for booked appointments only with a doctor.
