# Migration data for using in R

This folder contains a very large data file which is useful for demonstrating some of the functionality in R (dealing with large files etc)

It's actually the second part of two: the first is too large to upload to GitHub so you'll need to [get the first part of the data (on internal migration) on the ONS here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/datasets/internalmigrationbyoriginanddestinationlocalauthoritiessexandsingleyearofagedetailedestimatesdataset).

There is also a PDF with guidance, which in turn links to [the methodology on migration statistics here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/methodologies/internalmigrationmethodology).
