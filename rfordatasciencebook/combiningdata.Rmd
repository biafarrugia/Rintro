These are notes from the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - specifically the [section on relational data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#relational-data).

Let's start by installing the tidyverse collection of packages, and activating it in our library.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

And a few other packages that contain data we want to use:

```{r}
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

# 3 types of joins

Hadley outlines "three families of verbs designed to work with relational data":

* **Mutating joins**, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another. 
* **Filtering joins**, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.
* **Set operations**, which treat observations as if they were set elements.

And two types of **key**:

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, planes$tailnum is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the planes table.
* A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, the flights$tailnum is a foreign key because it appears in the flights table where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

You can use a **surrogate key** such as an index (row number) if the dataset has no key and values cannot be combined to create a unique one.

> "One way to [verify a primary key is unique] is to count() the primary keys and look for entries where n is greater than one:"

An **inner join** combines two tables based on a shared key. For example, one table may have coutries and their populations; another countries and their capital cities. If any key (in this case country) appears in only one of the tables, it does not survive the join. *Only matches survive*.

An **outer join**, however, keeps all observations even if the key only appears in one of the tables. *Which* tables depends on whether the outer join is a **left join**, a **right join** or a **full join**.

With a full join in the example above, all countries will survive the join, even if that means some rows only have the population of the country, but not its capital, and vice versa. A left join, however, would mean that all those with populations are kept (regardless of whether they appear in the other table), while a right join would mean that all those with capitals are kept.

A **left join** is similar to using the `VLOOKUP` function in a spreadsheet: this starts from some basic key data (let's say populations) and then tries to fetch *extra* data about it from elsewhee. It only looks for the countries in the original table, however. 

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-venn.png)
By default, a join will combine tables based on key *names* that are the same. But most of the time we need to specify which key to combine on, and more specifically the different names in different tables. In this example we are saying that the column 'dest' in one table means 'faa' in the other.

`left_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa"))`



```{r}
#Bring in the library of data
library(nycflights13)
#Check the uniqueness of the tailnum field in the planes data
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) #The result is a tibble with 0 rows because there are no matches
```

## Combining tables using `left_join()`

We can use the SQL-like function `left_join()` to join two tables on a common value. Note that this generates two outputs: the joined table but also a message about how it has decided to join the two original tables (because we haven't told it):

```{r}
#The two tables here have been generated in the cleaningtidydata.Rmd notebook - run the code in that notebook first.
left_join(tidy4a,tidy4b)
```
 ![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

## Using the SQL `select` command

Let's create a new dataset from the planes data using a pipe as the basis for a `select` command (think of the `%>%` as analagous to SQL's `FROM` command):

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>%
  #the colon indicates the columns between the two named
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) #select is a SQL command
flights2
```

Now we use `left_join` to convert those carrier codes into actual names. These are stored in another dataset, *airlines*, and we specify the column they have in common with `by = `

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin,-dest) %>% #two columns are removed first
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") #specify the common column to join on
```

### Doing the same with `mutate()`

Here's the code with `mutate()` instead. This time we specify the column from `airlines` we want to grab, and what column we are matching against in each. This can be useful if the columns don't have the same name in each dataset:

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)]) #grab the 'name' column from airlines, match the 'carrier' column from flights2, to the 'carrier' column in airlines
```


## Filtering joins: using `semi_join` and `anti_join` as a way to `filter` just *one* dataset

We *can* use `filter` to filter one dataset based on another dataset. First, we need a second dataset, which is the top 10 destinations:

```{r}
#Create a new variable using flights2
top_dest <- flights2 %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>% #count frequency of each destination, sort descending
  head(10) #generate the first 10 results
top_dest
```

Now for the filter:

```{r}
flights2 %>% #Use flights2 for the filter
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest) #where the value in dest is also in the same column in top_dest. There are 141,145 results out of 336,776
```

But we can do something similar with `semi_join` - and this will take more variables:

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  semi_join(top_dest)
#Note the console message: Joining, by = "dest"
```

This only joins where values in a common field are in both datasets, hence the console message: `Joining, by = "dest"`

### The `anti_join`: finding values that *don't* have a match

An opposite command, `anti_join`, will filter a dataset to only show those which *don't* match another.

```{r}
flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by="tailnum") %>% 
  count(tailnum, sort = T) #sort by count descending
```
This can be useful for finding primary keys in one table which don't match foreign keys in another.

## Set observations: `intersect`, `union` and `setdiff`

Finally the third type of join are 'set observations'. These look at the whole row (the 'set') and compare as follows:

* `intersect(x, y)`: return only observations in both x and y.
* `union(x, y)`: return unique observations in x and y.
* `setdiff(x, y)`: return observations in x, but not in y.

These can be used in the same way as `diff` to show differences 'before' and 'after' (for example what has been changed or removed between the two versions).
